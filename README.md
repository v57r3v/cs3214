CMPUT 474 Winter 2025 The Nature of Computation
Overview
This course will investigate the fundamental nature of computation, addressing the basic questions of what is (and is not) computable, what can (and cannot) be computed efficiently, and what consequences follow from certain machine and programming language restrictions. After an introduction to the foundations of computing and its relation to mathematics, the course will investigate finite state automata, regular languages, stack-augmented automata, context free languages, Turing machines, computability, recursive functions, the limits of mathematical reasoning, computational complexity, the classes P, NP and PSPACE, NP-completeness, and the complexity hierarchy.
